# About

We use [APEX](https://github.com/apex/apex) to manage the collection of lambda functions. This is an experiment so expect this documentation to change. 

## Development

1. The default `project.json` is initialized for the developer IAM. Make sure you have your AWS credentials [set up correctly](http://apex.run/#aws-credentials). This basically means an IAM Role for lambda functions have been created in the dev IAM.
